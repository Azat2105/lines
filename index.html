<h3>Lines</h3>
	<p>To move a ball, click on it with the mouse (circle will appear) to select it, then click on a free cell in a field. To deselect a ball just click on another. If movement is possible, ball will go to the specified empty field. After each turn, 3 new balls are placed on a field (random colours & positions). Preview panel shows colours of the next 3 balls. You can always force the next turn without moving anything. Click on preview panel. If the game field is full, game is over.</p>
	<p>Game goal is to arrange balls of the same colour in a straight lines (every direction). 5 or more balls on a straight line are removed and points are given. Longer lines give more points to you. Crossing lines count together.</p>
